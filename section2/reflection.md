## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  My first takeaway is that it's helpful for me to take a step back and give myself time to reflect on things that I just learned. Taking time to think about why something worked or didn't work really helps me solidify the concepts.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

  The ways in which I do are asking for help and understanding that mistakes are an important part of the learning process.

  The way in which I do not is seeking new challenges.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  It felt a little frustrating a first but it makes perfect sense because it is helping us get comfortable with navigating through these things on our own. It's helping us commit these things to memory.

4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

  It's sort of like a rule or guide. Or cause and effect. If you try to use your credit card when its maxed out it will be declined. In a web application if you enter a password incorrectly you will be denied access.

5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

  `if` statements evaluate a condition. If the condition comes back "true" it will run whatever is in the subsequent code. `else` adds another condition for when the `if` comes back "false".

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  Browser dev tools or Node.

7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

  How to simplify the process as the variables become more complex?
