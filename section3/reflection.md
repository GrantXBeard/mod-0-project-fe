## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

  It felt really good. I feel like I'm learning how to learn!

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  I use the website Discogs everyday. Arrays are probably used when organizing and storing information about musical artists and releases.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  Array methods are functionality built into JavaScript that allow you to work with elements within the array. You can add, subtract, reassign, sort ect.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

  A loop is used to check a condition a specific number of times or until a specific outcome is achieved.
  You could use a loop with an array if you wanted to log the same text with different variables.
  example " Hello <name>" with <name> being the variable run with however many names in an array.
  You could us a loop on its own to run text a specific number of times or count up or down.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  A task is done over and over again until it is told to stop.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

  I'm still a little rocky with combining loops, arrays, and if/else all together. But practice will help.
